# Program: Hello
# Description: In this project students will write a very simple
#              program using Pythonâ€™s input and output methods. The program
#              will prompt the user to enter responses to several questions, 
#              displaying the answer each time. The project is
#              designed to give students an opportunity to practice very 
#              basic input and output via a simple project
